- Now go in to your csgo/cfg directory and open the file named: "autoexec.cfg"
- Add the following line: ```es_load wcs/tools/standard``` to the autoexec.cfg file and hit save, and close the file. 
- Now go to your csgo/cfg/source-python/wcs/ directory and open the file named: ```Racepack Standard - (Version 1.0.0B).ini```
- Copy all the text, and paste it in to your races.ini file, thereafter remove the Racepack Standard file.
